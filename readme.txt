How to run the Webscraper:

1. Download the zip Auction Webscraper

2. Extract the zip into a regular folder 

3. Open the "dist" folder in the directory

4. Run the scrape.exe file 
	- for some reason the .exe will sometimes freeze when launching it, if this happens 
		just wait about 10 seconds and press space and it will keep going

5. Follow the inital prompt from the terminal, inserting a valid auctionhouseofbroadway url

6. The scraper should be running for about 1 minute if you look 
in the automated browser and the scrollbar is at the bottom of the page (or close to the bottom) 
just close the automated browser and it will still export the correct results to its respectful .csv

7. After closing the automated browser there will be a summary of the scrape in the terminal

8. Each different auction is going to have different .csv titles so make sure you look for the one
you scraped most recently


Notes:
Anything listed as "High Big" means the item sold at that price
If the listing has "Starting at" that means the item didn't sell
